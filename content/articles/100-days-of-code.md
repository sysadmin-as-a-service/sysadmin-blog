Scripting has always been one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. I love automating annoying, repetitive jobs, so I don't have to do them anymore. So I'd always been interested in the dev side of things and wondered if I could make a go of it.

I didn't plan on joining the hashtag 100 Days movement (and don't have one of those "Tweeter" account things, to tell other people about it), I really just wanted to set this goal of improving my software development skills. However, I'm terminally lazy slash very busy outside of work, so I set of goal of trying to practice coding //every day//.
This wasn't because I'm super good at goal setting, precisely the opposite. It's because I knew if I set a goal "Try code 4 hours a week" or something similar, I'd always be "too busy" to do any work on it each day. 
The only way, I thought, was to allow myself no excuses, no wiggle room, just every day, pick up the damn keyboard and start typing. 
And hey, it worked!

I managed to work on coding* every day, for at least 30 minutes, for 180 days straight!
\* By "work on coding", I defined as either a) coding b) reading coding documentation or occassionally c) watching a tutorial video etc.
