# Dear, WordPress
You've been my blog hosting platform for years now. From my first posts in 2015, we've spent many hours together (partly because your editor was terrible). You weren't especially... _attractive_, but you were dependable. Somewhat. 

But, it's time to move on. It's me, it's not you. To be honest... there's someone else. 

I'm moving on... to a static site generator.

Maybe we can still be friends?

# The New Hotness

Static sites are all the rage at the moment, and for good reason. This post isn't about the pros and cons of static sites vs. server side hosting, but more of a walkthrough of how I broke up with WordPress.com after more than 5 years of (sporadic) posting.

# First Steps

The first thing I needed to do was export my existing posts & media from WordPress. There's a few ways you can do this, but looking for something that would export direct to Markdown, I happened across [LoneKorean's Wordpress Export to Markdown script](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown).

First, export your WordPress content from within the WordPress admin page.

Then, run the WordPress Export script pointing to your XML file.
