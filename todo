Overall:
    - hmm maybe I should simplify, don't do a separate blog layout.vue - there'll only be two layouts, right? 
    homepage and post viewer. just put everything in _slug.vue.
    Have got vuex working.
    Now need to figure out how to get Recent Posts to show as a side bar, except on mobile


RecentPosts:
    - articles variable not loading for some reason @done
    - get recent posts component displaying on post viewer @done
    - make the recent posts on homepage into cards/boxes with short description
    - make the media boxes clickable nuxt-links

Store:
    - might have to implement vuex in order to allow Layouts and Recent Posts components to get list of articles etc. annoying. @done
    - add a filter to RecentPosts to just show 5 most Recent Posts

Extras:
    - add dark mode switch to navbar
    - add Google or Bing Analytics
    - add a contact button to homepage & navbar

Styling:
    - create a new icon/logo
    - set icon on homepage
    - set favicon
    - update link styling to be more subtle, both in text and headers
    - make the navbar menu item hover color grey instead of blue
    - lost the image shadows somehow, doesn't seem like img css is applying

Mobile:
    - fix up title of posts scroll bar
    - homepage title too big
